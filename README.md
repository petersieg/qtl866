Jan 2025: Quick hack to test 74 TTL chips. 

Edited devices.h to change all entries with 74HC (LS)153 -> 74153

Implemented in:

```
void MainWindow::on_exec_clicked()
{
...
    if (devname.toStdString().rfind("74", 0) == 0) { // pos=0 limits the search to the prefix
        // devname starts with prefix "74"
        args << "-T"; // testing devname device

    }
    else {
...

and:
void MainWindow::shellAppend(QString color, QString text)
{
    text = text.replace(QRegExp("\\x001b\\[0m"), " "); // this is needed for logic table output at testing 74 TTL ICs using ESC[0m for spacing
    text = text.replace(QRegExp("\\x001b\\[[^A-Z]*[A-Z]"), "\n"); // this formattes the progress percentage output line by line

```

There are three parts to this:

1) A shell script called miniprohex

The script is smart enough to determine the file type from the suffix
(.hex or .srec) and uses srec_cat to convert back and forth.

miniprohex by Al Williams http://www.awce.com

Usage:

  miniprohex [--o offset] [--unfill byte size] [--obs blksize] [--line-length length] [minipro_options] -r filename.ext

  miniprohex [--o offset] [minirpo_options] -w filename.ext

This calls minipro after converting known file types to 
.bin for writing or converting bin files after reading.

--o: Offset for file conversion (see srec_cat)

--unfill: Unfil blocks of at least size of byte (see srec_cat)

--obs: Output block size (see srec_cat)

--line-length: Output line length max (see srec_cat)

Assumes minipro and srec_cat are on the path.

2) A QT GUI for minipro

You need QTCreator to compile -- just open the .pro file and run it 
or compile from inside QTCreator.

By default, the GUI calls minipro (which it expects on the path).
But the options dialog lets you set a path, or you can point
to minipro.hex to get the features of miniprohex.

You can also add options there such as: miniprohex --obs 16

3) A shell script that allows for editing binary files

Using the same technique, binhexedit is a script that converts
hex or srec files to binary and calls a binary editor
(by default bless) to edit the file and then converts it back
on exit. This depends on srec_copy doing the conversion 
correctly in both directions, so you probably want to save a backup
unless you are directly editing a .bin file.

Assumes bless and binhexedit are in your path. You need a -r to read
a file with binhexedit as in:

binhexedit -r test.hex

You can set the name of the binary editor in the options dialog.
